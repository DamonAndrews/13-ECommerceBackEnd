# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. You’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Here is a functional back-end for an e-commerce site. The started code has been modified, and there is a working Express.js API using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes can be executed to present data.
